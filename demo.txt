varibles in javaript 
---------------------------------
varible are the refrences which points to memory location


why do we required varible
varible are required to store the data in the memory while exectuting program,so that we can utilise the data to do some action or after exectuting the program ,we might required to sore some output

what is varible?
what is program?
what is Process
Why do you want varibles in the progrmas?

how to create a varibles in javaript ?
scope Statments
var and let and const 

syntax:
=======
declared in any kind varibles or else (varible declarzation)
we just created one varible inside a ram one bucket are created this bucket some created some address .out this varible point they address

syntax
======

<scope Statments><varible Name>;
var x;
let name;

assigned any kind value 
<varible Name>=<data>
x=10

intalization varible
<scopeName><varible Name>=<data>
var x=10;



/////////////////////=====================================
this data type totoally are divided 8 data type
primitive data type and non primitive data type
out of 8 is 7 is coming primitve data type 
primitive data type 7 =>number,string,boolean,bigint,undefine,symbool
non primitive data type 1 =>object

can u least out all type of data type are their
can u tell me list our all primitive data type 
can u tell me list out all non primitve data type 
what is differnce btwn primive data type non promitive data type ;
they are totoally 8 type of data type 
all they 8 types data type divide two category
primitive and non primitive
prmitive 
=========
out of of seven data type is primitive data type
string number boolean bigint symbool ,undefine,null
all this above 7 data types are inbuilt data types in javasript are primive data immutable is 
immutable is means we cant change data
we can assigned ressgined data like 
var data=10;
<scope Name><data name>=<DATA>
data is fixed  but we can  assigned value 

==================
non primitive
object =>Data type which is derived from primitive data type is called non-primitive data type
data whose value can be modifed non primitive data type are mutable data types.
mutable value 
we can change value or  re assgined value


=================
datatype
================
typeof is one type operator identify any varible
in javasript two special value
1.> null 
2.> undefine
why null value datatype of null is object
in javaript null value is considered is object
special value called primitive type
null ======> object ======> primitive type ===>under come null type
any data 2 power 53-1 is coming bigint type
symbool() any type of data sum() constructor come under sumboll type

oop 
| class,object,constructor


object
when ever any kind varible if we are assgined object or array that come under object type
var id={};//intalization varible
var data=[abc]//
both are object








//functions
parameter functions
return function:return keyword
anymyos function
callback function 
arrow function
higher order function


⭐⭐⭐⭐//object in javasript
what is object how to read a javaript

array and array method
string and stinr methid
selection statment if else else-if,switch
loops
they are five loops
while
d0-while
for 
for of
for in

basic of javascript
