Definition of Variables:
varible are the refrences which points to memory location
Questions:
============================================================
What is a variable?

A variable is a reference that points to a memory location to store and retrieve data during program execution.
What is a program?

A program is a set of instructions or a sequence of code that performs a specific task when executed.
What is a process?

A process is the execution of a program in a computer system. It involves the program's code being loaded into memory and its instructions being executed.
Why do we need variables in programs?

Variables are needed to store and manage data during program execution, enabling the program to perform operations and produce output.

Variable Declaration and Initialization:
====================================
<scope Statments><varible Name>;

Declaration: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.
var x;
===============
Assignment: Values can be assigned to var variables later in the code.
<varible Name>=<data>

x = 10;
===================
Initialization: Both declaration and assignment can be done in one step.
<scopeName><varible Name>=<data>

var y = 20;


Data Types in JavaScript:
=======================================
JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data types.
=============================
Primitive Data Types: number, string, boolean, bigint, undefined, null, symbol.
===================================================
 String to Number:
let stringValue = "123";
let numberValue = +stringValue; // Converts string to number

parseInt() can be used to parse a string and return an integer.
let stringValue = "456";
let numberValue = parseInt(stringValue); // Converts string to integer

The String() constructor can be used to convert a number to a string.
let stringValue = "456.78";
let numberValue = parseFloat(stringValue); // Converts string to float

boolean suppose undefined,null,0 is false
boolean suppose 1 to 100 or 'subham is value 1

Non-Primitive Data Type: object.
================================
Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types:


Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed directly. but reassgined value
                         ==========                       =========================
Non-primitive data types (objects) are mutable, and their values can be modified.
==================                    ==========                  ==============
Special Values:
typeof operator is used to identify the type of a variable.
Special values: null and undefined.
=====================
null is considered an object in JavaScript.
==========================

in javaript null value is considered is object
special value called primitive type
null ======> object ======> primitive type ===>under come null type
any data 2 power 53-1 is coming bigint type
symbool() any type of data sum() constructor come under sumboll type


object
when ever any kind varible if we are assgined object or array that come under object type
var id={};//intalization varible
var data=[abc]//
