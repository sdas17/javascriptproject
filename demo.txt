Definition of Variables:
varible are the refrences which points to memory location
Questions:
============================================================
What is a variable?

A variable is a reference that points to a memory location to store and retrieve data during program execution.
What is a program?

A program is a set of instructions or a sequence of code that performs a specific task when executed.
What is a process?

A process is the execution of a program in a computer system. It involves the program's code being loaded into memory and its instructions being executed.
Why do we need variables in programs?

Variables are needed to store and manage data during program execution, enabling the program to perform operations and produce output.

Variable Declaration and Initialization:
====================================

Declaration: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.
var x;
===============
Assignment: Values can be assigned to var variables later in the code.

x = 10;
===================
Initialization: Both declaration and assignment can be done in one step.

Data Types in JavaScript:
=======================================
JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data types.
=============================
Primitive Data Types: number, string, boolean, bigint, undefined, null, symbol.
===================================================
Non-Primitive Data Type: object.
================================
Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types:
Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed directly. but reassgined poosivke
                     =============                       =========================
Non-primitive data types (objects) are mutable, and their values can be modified.
==================                    ==========                  ==============
Special Values:
typeof operator is used to identify the type of a variable.
Special values: null and undefined.
=====================
null is considered an object in JavaScript.
